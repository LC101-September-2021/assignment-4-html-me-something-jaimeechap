         <h2>College</h2>
            <p>I attended college at Truman State University from August 2008-December 2011. I changed my major a few times. I went in as a pre-law student and left with a double major in English Literature and French Literature. I got a minor in French translation and hoped to move to France to work as a translator. Unfortunately, that didn't pan out, and I stayed in Missouri and moved back in with my parents.</p>

         <h2>Convergys</h2>
            <p>After college, I worked for a call center for AT&T. I fielded calls from customers who wanted to cancel their cell service and worked as a "manager" in the escalations department. I realized that I needed to go back to school to do something, but I wasn't sure what. I decided to try getting a masters degree in teaching for students who speak English as a second language. I spent a semester at UMSL and realized I was spending a ton of money on something I wasn't 100% sure I would love. I ended up enrolling in an alternative teaching certification program (ABCTE) to get a teaching certificate in middle and high school English.</p>

         <h2>Moving to Troy</h2>
            <p>My then boyfriend (now husband) Michael got a job as a middle school English teacher in Troy, Missouri for the 2013-2014 school year. He asked me to move to Troy with him, so I did. I quickly got a job as a paraprofessional in a special education/life skills classroom. All of the students were non-verbal and required a great deal of care. I wasn't completely sure what the job entailed when I signed on, but I was excited to have normal hours and do something different. I ended up loving the kids I was working with. I took the Praxis (teaching certification test) in Special Education and Elementary Education and passed. My work as a paraprofessional counted as student teaching for the ABCTE certification process, so I was a fully certified teacher by the winter of 2014. </p>
         
         <h2>Troy Middle School</h2>
            <p>I got my first job as a 6th grade special education English teacher at Troy Middle School, the same school as my husband. I was a co-teacher in the general education setting for half of the school day and taught a self-contained Applied English class for students with disabilities. After two years, I felt ready for a change and applied to several school districts, including Special School District of St. Louis County.</p>

         <h2>Rockwood</h2>
            <p>Special School District hired me and brought me to the Rockwood School District, where I worked for three years at the elementary level. I started in a self-contained, cross-categorical disabilities special education room. I loved my kids and learned a lot. Unfortunately, Rockwood/SSD was fading out the self-contained cross-cat classroom model. My numbers were too low, so my room was the next room to get cut. I moved to work as a resource teacher. Around that time, I thought I would enjoy teaching more if I built up my confidence with a more formal education program. </p>

         <h2>KU</h2>
            <p>I applied to the University of Kansas's online masters in special education program. I earned my Master of Science in Special Education with an emphasis in Autism Spectrum Disorder. I also received a certificate in Special Education Teacher Leadership. Most of my coursework was related to autism, and I enjoyed my program.</p>
         <h2>Parkway</h2>
            <p>I was a resource teacher at Claymont Elementary for two years. I still didn't feel like I was in the right place, so I requested a transfer to be the Parkway Virtual Campus elementary resource teacher, which is my current position.</p>

         <h2>Launchcode</h2>
            <p>I have tried working as a teacher in multiple schools, multiple districts, and different types of classrooms. Everything is the same-- I love the kids, I enjoy helping people with disabilities, but I feel like I would be happier if I wasn't teaching. A friend who did Codergirl told me about the program, so I applied and did not get accepted. A year later after a particularly rough day of work, my friends and husband convinced me to apply to LC101 and try to change my career. I followed their advice and applied the day before applications closed. Thankfully, I was accepted! </p>

         <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
            <p>I have always been interested in technology. In high school, I loved modifying my pages on MySpace and STLPunk using html. I never thought tech was an option for me because I was never very good at math. However, I have always been good at problem solving and I enjoy it. I absolutely love puzzles, particularly logic and crossword puzzles, and I enjoy being challenged. The feeling when you finally solve a problem that you've been struggling over is exhilarating and I seek it out every day. </p>
            
          <h2>My future career goals</h2>  
            <p>Coding will give me the lifestyle I want and a career that I truly believe will make me fulfilled. I'm hoping to transition into something focused on accessibility for individuals with disabilities and those who are neurodivergent. As someone who is neurodivergent herself (I have ADHD) along with my experience as a special education teacher, I have insight that others do not have. I am also interested in working for an educational tech company.</p>
